1:  we repeat some code, in median and histogram function we used the same code lines , and in max and min,
In min and max functions we repeated the code , the only difference was the two paramters min and max and the if cases in the two
functions, to decrease the repetiton in our code we should've used the same function for min and max (implementing function which help us in both functions) 
for example we could do a function that takes another parameter (1 for min and 0 for max)and adding  a new if case to it.
2: answer: yes , the grades that we choose are uniformly divided. we can check this by using the median function, so  by giving the median 
function some random grades (by the command that you gives us in the HW) we will see that the median is so close to 50.
so  half of the grades that we take randomly are smaller than 50 and the other numbers are bigger than 50,
in other words we can check this by the median function that we have implemented.
